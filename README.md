# AmeisenBotX 🐜

This marks the final iteration of my WoW bot, drawing from lessons learned in the previous two attempts and rebuilt from the ground up. The main focus of this bot is to emulate a human-like group player, playing the game alongside you, handling tasks from equipment management to resource gathering throughout your adventure. 🤖🔄
